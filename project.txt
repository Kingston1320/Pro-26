Recipe of Ragda Patties:-
The 3 Elements of Ragda Patties
This snack food recipe requires three key components:

Potato Patties –  Mashed potatoes are formed in patties and pan fried or shallow fried until crisp. They are crunchy, lightly spiced and taste so good when enjoyed as part of this dish or even eaten plain on their own.
Ragda  – Dried white peas are cooked with a few spices in a creamy curry 
(or gravy) until soft and flavorful.

Toppings – For authentic ragda pattice, you need to top the curry and crispy potato patties with an assortment of chutneys, yogurt, veggies and spices. These are optional, but I highly recommend you include:
Green Coriander Chutney – Either made just with coriander leaves, or coriander and mint.
Red Chilli Chutney – Made from dry red Kashmiri chilies and garlic.
Sweet Tamarind Chutney – Made with dried tamarind, jaggery or sugar and a few spices.
Yogurt or curd – Adds a terrific bit of tangy creaminess and richness.
Onions and tomatoes – These veggies add a lovely bit of fresh flavor.
Sev – Fried gram flour vermicelli that gives the dish great crunchiness.
Ground spices – I use a combination of chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, and black salt or regular salt.
Pomegranate arils – These ruby red, tangy-sweet Pomegranate arils bring some freshness, color and crunch to the dish.
